/**
 * Install emitted artifacts into the API's form tree.

 * The emitters deliberately know nothing about where this application keeps forms --

 * write to their own stable output directories and this step installs from there.
 *
 * It also applies the snake_case projection (see naming.mjs) and lays the artifacts out
 * as the form.json plus sibling schema files that _loader.py reads.
 *
 * Only a form declaring `@Sgg.sync` is installed. The emitter records that, and the form's
 * renderer, in `sgg.json`; the rest compile and emit but stay out of the API tree.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync.mjs            write the files
 *   node scripts/sync.mjs --check    fail if what is committed differs (drift gate)
