"""The per-form record of accepted differences.

Each side compares a form definition against a source. Fields that correspond and agree
need no declaration; everything else goes in one of three registers, keyed by path with a
reason as the value.

    absent_from_source      the definition has it, the source does not
    absent_from_definition  the source has it, the definition does not reach it
    differing_rules         both have it, under different rules

`compare.stale_entries` on each side holds every entry to both documents, so an entry that
stops describing a real difference fails the suite. An entry records a defect to fix, not
an exemption from fixing it.

Each side subclasses this to name the documents it reads and add what it alone needs:
`json_schema/` adds `renamed`, `xml/` adds `unreadable`.
