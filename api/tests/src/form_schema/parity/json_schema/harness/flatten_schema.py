"""Reads a form's JSON Schema into `{path: FormInput}`.

Two forms that ask for the same things can be written as very different documents. The
generated SF-424 hoists 50 shared questions into `$defs` and composes with `allOf`; the
hand-written one declares no `$defs` at all and inlines everything. The two share no
definition name, so a structural diff of the documents is all noise -- and resolving the
refs makes it worse, since `resolve_jsonschema` expands each one in place while keeping
`$defs`, leaving the country code list in the generated schema four times over.

Flattening keeps only the path an answer lives at and the rules that decide whether it is
valid, which makes the two comparable. These produce the same result:

    # hoisted behind a $ref, composed with allOf
    {"$defs": {"Email": {"type": "string", "format": "email", "maxLength": 60}},
     "properties": {"contact": {"allOf": [
         {"type": "object", "properties": {"email": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Email"}}},
         {"required": ["email"]}]}}}

    # inlined, and annotated
    {"properties": {"contact": {
         "type": "object",
         "required": ["email"],
         "properties": {"email": {"title": "Email address",
                                  "description": "Where we will reach you.",
                                  "type": "string", "format": "email", "maxLength": 60}}}}}

    both -> {("contact", "email"): FormInput(
                 required=True,
                 rules={"format": "email", "maxLength": 60, "type": "string"})}

`$ref` is resolved upstream by `src.form_schema.jsonschema_resolver`; `allOf` is folded by
`merge_schema.py`; titles and descriptions are dropped because they change what an
applicant reads, not what they may submit.

Where two forms spell one field differently -- `p.phone` against `p.phone_number` -- the
`FormInput` values match and only the path differs. `FormDiff.renamed` pairs those up.

One array keyword is not read: `prefixItems`, which gives item 0 a different shape from
items 1+. A path ends in one `[]` step describing every item, so a positional difference
has nowhere to go. `sf424a` is the only form using it, and the requiredness it declares
there is invisible here -- see `documentation/api/form-parity-open-questions.md`.

`../../xml/harness/flatten_xsd.py` produces the same shape over element names.
