"""Folds `allOf` branches into one schema, or raises.

    -> {"type": "string", "maxLength": 60}

    {"allOf": [{"maxLength": 60}, {"maxLength": 200}]}
    -> AmbiguousComposition

A validator applies every branch, so two `maxLength` values behave as the smaller. A
flattener has no payload and would have to pick one; picking 200 silently accepts values
the schema rejects. Rather than implement precedence, this raises. No form in `diffs/`
declares a keyword twice, so nothing currently raises.

`if`/`then`/`else` branches are left in place, since which applies depends on the payload.

`allof-merge` and `json-schema-merge-allof` do this off the shelf. They resolve a conflict
by choosing a winner, which is the behaviour this cannot have.
