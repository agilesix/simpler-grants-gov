"""Fixture tests for the functions in `harness/`.

`test_forms.py` runs these functions over real forms, where almost everything lines up.
These run them over hand-built `FormInput` dictionaries chosen to break them, so each rule
is visible on its own.

One class per function under test. `TestInputRules` covers `flatten_schema.inputs()`
instead, since the way it canonicalises a rule decides what `rule_differences()` sees.
