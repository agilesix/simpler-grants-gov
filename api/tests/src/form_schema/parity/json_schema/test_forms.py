"""Whether a generated form asks for the same things as the hand-written form it mirrors.

Both schemas are flattened to `{path: FormInput}` and held against the `FormDiff` the form
declares in `diffs/`. A difference neither the record accounts for nor the flattening
discards is a failure.

`test_generated_form_does_not_add_extra_fields` and its counterpart are the only checks
that can see a field one form has and the other lacks: neither schema sets
`additionalProperties`, so an unexpected field validates cleanly on both.

The rule comparison reads a flattened schema, which is an approximation a validator never
has to make -- `merge_schema.py` folds `allOf`, and `if`/`then` branches are left where
they are. It reports every field and keyword that differs in one pass, where a validator
would need a payload that exercises each one.
