"""Whether a form's XML mapping agrees with the Grants.gov schema it targets.

`RecursiveXMLTransformer` iterates over the mapping's rules, not over the applicant's
answers, so a response field with no rule is never visited and does not appear in the
submission. Most Grants.gov elements are `minOccurs="0"`, so the document still validates
and neither `xmllint` nor a snapshot notices.

The comparisons are in `harness/compare.py`, covered by fixtures in `test_harness.py`.
Each form declares a `FormDiff` in `diffs/` recording its known gaps, and
`TestRecordedDifferences` fails if an entry stops describing one.
