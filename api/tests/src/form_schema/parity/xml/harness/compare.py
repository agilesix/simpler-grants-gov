"""Compares a form's XML mapping against the XSD it targets and the form's own schema.

`flatten()` reads all three documents into paths, so every check below is a dictionary
comparison and no fixture has to populate the right field for a mistake to surface.

    mapping vs XSD    undeclared_targets, unsourced_elements, out_of_order_elements
    mapping vs form   unmatched_fields
    form vs XSD       rule_differences
    the record        stale_entries, unrecorded_skips

Every function takes a `FlatForm`; `xml/test_harness.py` builds them by hand. Only the
`mapping vs form` and `form vs XSD` comparisons consult the record -- a target naming an
undeclared element, or a required element nothing feeds, fails with no way to record an
exception.
