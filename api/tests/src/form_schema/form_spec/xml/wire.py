"""An XSD's elements and attributes as paths, so a mapping can be compared against it.

The XSD counterpart of `parity/paths.py`. A path is a tuple of element names from the
root's children down; an attribute is a step prefixed with `@`.

Reads the XSDs the API already vendors under `src/services/xml_generation/xsds/`.
`xmlschema` follows the imports into `GlobalLibrary` and `UniversalCodes`, so an element
typed `globLib:AddressDataTypeV3` arrives with its children and facets resolved.
