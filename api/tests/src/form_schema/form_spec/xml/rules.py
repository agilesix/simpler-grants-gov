"""An XML mapping flattened the same way `wire.py` flattens an XSD.

A form's `json_to_xml_schema` nests response fields the way the wire nests elements, so it
reads into `{element path: response field}` and the checks become dictionary comparison.

Three details the format carries:

- Attachments are named twice. `xml_transform.target` holds a lowercase placeholder that
  only fixes sequence position; the element emitted is in `_xml_config.attachment_fields`.
- Containers carry no value. A `nested_object`, `array` or `static_value` element maps to
  no response field.
- Not every mapping is tree-shaped. SF-424A's synthesises structure from data at run time,
  so those nodes land in `unreadable` and the checks skip the form.
